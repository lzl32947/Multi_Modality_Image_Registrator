# Image Registrator

The labeling tools for multi-modal image registration.

## Description

## Requirement
Only two packages are needed in the project, which separately used for GUI and image processing.

```


## How to use
This tool is initially designed for the [FLIR dataset](https://www.flir.com/oem/adas/adas-dataset-form/), which is the infrared-visible object detection dataset. However, the image in the dataset are not correctly registered. And the first release is to solve this issue manually.
